# Task 8-Working and Understanding VPN (Virtual Private Networks)

## üìå Objective:
To understand the working of VPNs and how they protect user privacy and secure communication.

---

## VPN Used:
**ProtonVPN (Free Tier)**  
- Chosen for its strong privacy policy and ease of use.

---

## Setup Process:
1. Signed up at [https://protonvpn.com](https://protonvpn.com)
2. Installed the VPN client on Windows.
3. Connected to a Netherlands-based VPN server.
4. Verified IP address before and after connection.

| State        | IP Address       | Location      |
|--------------|------------------|---------------|
| Before VPN   | 106.215.171.42   | India         |
| After VPN    | 185.107.56.164   | Netherlands   |

5. Confirmed traffic encryption (visited websites used HTTPS).
6. Browsing speed was slightly slower after VPN connection.
7. Disconnected VPN and noticed IP reverted to original.

## Benefits and Limitations:

**Benefits:**
- Protects online activity from ISPs and hackers.
- Encrypts data over public networks (e.g., caf√© Wi-Fi).
- Helps bypass region-based restrictions.

**Limitations:**
- Slower speeds on free servers.
- Limited server access.
- Must trust the VPN provider‚Äôs privacy claims.

## üìÑ Summary
This task involved using ProtonVPN to understand how VPNs secure internet traffic and protect user privacy. I connected to a server in the Netherlands, verified IP address changes, and observed the impact on browsing speed. I also explored VPN features like encryption, kill switch, and DNS leak protection.

## üß† Learnings
- Understood how VPNs hide IP addresses and encrypt data.
- Learned about key features like AES-256 encryption and no-log policies.
- Noted pros like privacy and safe public Wi-Fi use, and cons like speed reduction.
- Realized VPNs are privacy tools, not full security solutions.
